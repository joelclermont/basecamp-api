The goal of this project is to create a complete implementation of the Basecamp API

View the [full API documentation](http://developer.37signals.com/basecamp/index.shtml)

All data types and methods will be supported (over time).

Update: I'm making use of two Microsoft DLLs from the [WCF Web APIs](http://wcf.codeplex.com) HTTP Preview 1

Download and unzip it at the same level as your git repo before building the project locally. 
It contains two essential libraries: Microsoft.Http and Microsoft.Http.Extensions
