The goal of this project is to create a complete implementation of the Basecamp API

View the [full API documentation](http://developer.37signals.com/basecamp/index.shtml)

All data types and methods will be supported (over time).

Note: I'm making use of two Microsoft DLLs from the [REST Starter Kit](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/releases/view/24644)
Download and install it to get a copy of Microsoft.Http.dll and Microsoft.Http.Extensions.dll before building the project locally.
